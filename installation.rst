Plugin Installation
-------------------

Install a specific Plugin version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install a specific version of a plugin use the ``--version`` flag.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge install html-report --version 4.0.7


Add Plugins to a Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run this command from within the project directory, to install the plugin and add it to project.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge install <plugin_name>

If the plugin is already installed, Gauge just adds it to the project.


Offline Installation of Plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any Gauge plugin can be installed from a zip file instead of downloading
from plugin repository by using the ``--file`` or ``-f`` flag.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge install html-report --file ZIP_FILE_PATH

Download the latest version of plugin from the ``Releases`` section of the respective repository. See `plugin list <//gauge.org/plugins/>`__ to find the repositories.

Updating Plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run this command to update your plugin.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge update <plugin_name>

This downloads the latest compatible plugin from our plugin repository.

.. note::
    Every Gauge plugin when published, has metadata indicating the ``min`` and ``max`` version of Gauge that it is compatible with. This is used when installing plugins on a system running a particular gauge version.


**Example**

.. code-block:: console

    gauge update java

To update a plugin to a specific version, use the ``--version`` flag.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge update java --version 0.7.1

You can also update all the installed plugins by running

.. code-block:: console

    gauge update --all

Read the :ref:`Installation troubleshooting <troubleshoot_plugin_installation>` for more.

.. note::

    The html-report and screenshot plugins are installed automatically on the first run.

.. _plugins-uninstallation:

Uninstall Plugins
-----------------

Plugins can be uninstalled using the ``uninstall`` subcommand. The command is

``gauge uninstall <plugin-id>``

Example:

.. code-block:: console

   gauge uninstall java

To uninstall a specific version of the plugin, use the
``--version`` flag.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

   gauge uninstall java --version 0.7.1


Troubleshooting
===============

.. _troubleshoot_gauge_installation:

Gauge Installation
------------------

Here are some troubleshooting tips to common errors when installing Gauge.

Installing with npm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Make sure that you're using the `Long Term Supported version of Node <https://nodejs.org/en/>`__. Upgrade to this version by running ``npm install -g npm@latest``.


Installing with Homebrew
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-  If you're using brew, run ``brew update`` before installing the latest version of gauge.
-  If installation is failing `Upgrade homebrew <http://docs.brew.sh/FAQ.html#how-do-i-update-my-local-packages>`__

Windows
^^^^^^^

If you're on Windows, make sure that:

-  the default installation location is ``%ProgramFiles%\gauge``.
-  ``gauge_install_location\bin`` should be in PATH to run from command line.
-  Gauge plugins are installed at ``%APPDATA%\gauge\plugins`` directory.
-  `APPDATA <https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/app-settings/store-and-retrieve-app-data>`__ directory is usually located at ``C:\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming``.

Mac OS X
^^^^^^^^

If you're using MacOS, make sure that:

-  the default installation location is ``/usr/local/``.
-  ``usr/local/bin/`` or ``custom_install_location/bin`` should be in PATH.
-  Gauge plugins are installed under ``~/.gauge/plugins`` directory.

Linux
^^^^^

If you're using Linux, make sure that:

-  the default installation location is ``/usr/local/``
-  ``usr/local/bin/`` or ``custom_install_location/bin`` should be in PATH.
-  Gauge plugins are installed under ``~/.gauge/plugins`` directory.

.. _troubleshoot_plugin_installation:

Plugin installation
-------------------

-  If :ref:`plugin installation <install_plugins>` fails due to a network connection issue, you can **manually download** the plugin distributable zip and install it using the ``-f`` flag.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge install plugin_name -f path_to_zip_file

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge install html-report -f html-report-4.0.7-darwin.x86.zip

-  Find the plugin zip files under ``Releases`` section of the plugin github repositories. See the `gauge plugin list <https://gauge.org/plugins/>`__ for plugin repositories details.

Plugins directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Plugins are installed in the ``.gauge/plugins`` directory in user's home. You can check this directory to manually install / uninstall plugins as well as to verify the installed plugins.

The plugin installation directory for various operating systems are listed below.

-  **Windows:** ``%APPDATA%\.gauge\plugins``
-  **Mac OS X:** ``~/.gauge/plugins``
-  **Linux:** ``~/.gauge/plugins``

Custom Plugin Install location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default the plugins are stored at ``%APPDATA%\gauge\plugins`` for windows and ``~/.gauge/plugins`` in mac and linux.

To install plugins at different location, set ``GAUGE_HOME`` environment variable to the custom location. After setting the ``GAUGE_HOME`` env, run the install command. The plugin will get installed at the ``GAUGE_HOME`` custom location.

Logs
----

-  Gauge logs are created under the ``logs`` directory in the project.
-  Three log files are created
    -  **gauge.log** - logs for test execution
    -  **api.log** - logs for gauge core api exposed for plugins
    -  **lsp.log** - logs for gauge when launched in LSP mode.

-  To customize logs directory set the ``logs_directory`` property in the ``env/default/default.properties`` file to a custom logs directory path.

.. code-block:: text

    logs_directory = my_logs_dir

-  For **non-project specific actions** like plugin installation log
   files are created in the following location.

.. code-block:: text

     Windows - %APPDATA%\gauge\logs
     MacOS*  - <user_home>/.gauge/logs
     Linux   - <user_home>/.gauge/logs
