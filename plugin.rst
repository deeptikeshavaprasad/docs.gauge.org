Plugins
============

| This page provides information about different types of plugins supported by Gauge and plugin installation and uninstallation. Plugins help you to use additional features of Gauge.
| For information about installing Gauge on your system, see :ref:`install_gauge`.

.. _install_plugins:

Install Plugins
------------------
To install a plugin and add the plugin to a Gauge project, use the following command from within the project directory:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge install <plugin_name>

If the plugin is already installed, Gauge just adds the plugin to the project.

.. note::

    The html-report and screenshot plugins are installed automatically on the first run.

Install a specific plugin version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install a specific version of a plugin, use the ``--version`` flag on your command line:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge install <plugin_name> --version <plugin_version>
    

**Example**

.. code-block:: console

    gauge install html-report --version 4.0.7

Install plugins offline 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also install a plugin from a zip file instead of downloading from the plugin repository by using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   gauge install <plugin_name> --file ZIP_FILE_PATH

You can download the latest version of a plugin from the ``Releases`` section of the plugin's GitHub repository. See the `plugin list <https://gauge.org/plugins/>`_ to find the Gauge repositories.

Customize plugin install location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the plugins are stored at ``%APPDATA%\gauge\plugins`` in Windows and ``~/.gauge/plugins`` in Mac OS X and Linux systems. You can also install the plugins at different locations.

1. To install plugins at a different location, set ``GAUGE_HOME`` environment variable to the custom location. 
2. | Run the ``plugin install`` command. 
   | The plugin is installed at the ``GAUGE_HOME`` custom location.

For troubleshooting information during plugin installation, see :ref:`Troubleshooting plugin installation <troubleshoot_plugin_installation>`.

Update Plugins
----------------

You can update a plugin by using the ``gauge update`` command. This command downloads the latest compatible plugin from the `Gauge plugin repository <https://gauge.org/plugins/>`_ .

.. code-block:: console

    gauge update <plugin_name>

.. note::
    Every Gauge plugin when published has metadata indicating the ``min`` and ``max`` version of Gauge that the plugin is compatible with. The ``gauge update`` command is used when installing plugins on a system running a particular gauge version.


**Example**

.. code-block:: console

    gauge update java

- To update a plugin to a specific version, use the ``--version`` flag as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge update java --version 0.7.1

- To update all the installed plugins, use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge update --all

.. _plugins-uninstallation:

Uninstall Plugins
--------------------

Uninstall the plugins by using the following command:

``gauge uninstall <plugin_name>``

Example:

.. code-block:: console

   gauge uninstall java

To uninstall a specific version of the plugin, use the
``--version`` flag.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

   gauge uninstall java --version 0.7.1

.. _troubleshoot_plugin_installation:

Troubleshooting Plugin Installation
-----------------------------------

If :ref:`plugin installation <install_plugins>` fails due to a network connection issue, you can manually download the plugin distributable zip and install the plugin by using the following command:

 .. code-block:: console

    gauge install <plugin_name> -f path_to_zip_file

Example:

.. code-block:: console

   gauge install html-report -f html-report-4.0.7-darwin.x86.zip

-  You can find the plugin zip files in the ``Releases`` section of the plugin GitHub repositories. See the `gauge plugin list <https://gauge.org/plugins/>`__ for plugin repository details.

Plugins directory
-----------------

Plugins are installed in the ``.gauge/plugins`` directory in the user's home directory. You can check this directory to manually install or uninstall plugins and also to verify the installed plugins.

The plugin installation directory for various operating systems are listed below.

-  Windows: ``%APPDATA%\.gauge\plugins``
-  Mac OS X: ``~/.gauge/plugins``
-  Linux: ``~/.gauge/plugins``
