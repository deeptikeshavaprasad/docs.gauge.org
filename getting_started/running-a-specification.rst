Running a Specification
=======================

.. include:: ../change_filter.rst
.. role:: highlighted-syntax
.. role:: param-syntax-char

Now that you successfully initialized a Gauge project with the JavaScript template, we can look at
running a specification using the example spec in the test folder.


A test specification (spec) is a detailed statement of what will be tested. In Gauge, these are written
in a spec file.To learn more about how specifications work you can look at the owerview section.
